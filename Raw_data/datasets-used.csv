We define our day as midnight-to-midnight, Pacific time. Cities represent usage in greater metropolitan areas and are stably defined during this period. In many countries/regions and cities, relative volume has increased since January 13th, consistent with normal, seasonal usage of Apple Maps. Day of week effects are important to normalize as you use this data.Data that is sent from usersâ€™ devices to the Maps service is associated with random, rotating identifiers so Apple doesnâ€™t have a profile of your movements and searches.","Mobility, covid-19"
